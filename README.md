self-hosted web server > static webblog; not a whole lot of need of CPU and memory


keeping it as traditional server with apache

**domain lvl email sys**
DNSExit offers a free tier of service. US domain names do not have the normal hidden domain privacy settings.

**Private domain registration records **
DNSExit the service costs $1.99 per domain per year.

**SSL**
SSL certificates are free at DNSExit

I could 
**renew own certs**
Certbot
**do the domains**
Let's Encrypt
I will likely let DNSExit manage the certificates

I wanted private registration at DNSExit and that cost something *i will confirm* per domain name per year. The email address used by DNSExit is [domain-name]@private.netdorm.com

I self-serve one website, to ensure the domain is pointing to the correct websit outside of my own network, I use GeoPeeker & LocalBrowser to check the site.
